# Turtle-Tron
Turtle Tron is a game based off tron legacy and using the turtle library. Turtle tron conssits of 2 players or 2 bikes.
The goal of the game is to surivive longer than you're enemy. Turtle Tron is going to have lots of updates in the future sincei am only a begginer on programming and python overall but eventually i plan to add things like self driving bikes using AI, and remaking the entire game in better librarys like pygame that give me more room for expansion and features.

# Note
This game was made when i first learning so there may be bugs. I will improve it eventually and re write the code one day.
